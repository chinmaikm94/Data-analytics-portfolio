I had worked for 3 years as Structural Design Engineer in a Structural engineering consultancy in Bengaluru. Being a part of an R&D team in my previous company built a curiosity in me to learn more about Analytics field. This led me to join a Data Analytics course to get hands-on training on skills and projects to enhance my professional knowledge to ultimately land a job as a Data Analyst.

This is a repository to showcase skills and share projects and track in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
